#Introduction

gsutil is a tool written in Python that let's you access the Google Storage cloud from the command line. It allows you to do the following:

+ Creating and deleting buckets.
+ Uploading, downloading, and deleting objects.
+ Listing buckets and objects.
+ Moving, copying, and renaming objects.
+ Editing object and bucket ACLs.

This guide will cover how to install gsutil onto your slot. It won't go into detail in how to set up Google Cloud Platform, however.
